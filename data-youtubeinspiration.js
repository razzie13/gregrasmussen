    "This is the guy who's story of getting into software development is what inspired me to do the same. His YouTube videos usually come out weekly and don't teach code, but rather talk about getting into the field, issues that you will face in your journey, questions you should be asking yourself while you learn, as well as what the software development industry can be like.",

    "Chris will not teach you code either, but he will be real with you about what it's like getting in the field, being in the field, dealing with imposter syndrome, and what the rewards are when you're successful. His YouTube videos can be sparatic at times, but they are well worth the watch to see the journey he has been on, and after a while, you will likely be able to identify with the guy quite well."

    "He deserves more views than he gets - puts plenty of effort into his lessons, which are concise and teach you what you need to know in an energized lesson. Jesse is more on the design end of the spectrum, diving deep into UX/UI work and freelancing, but he will give you valuable insights into how to build and design your projects from both a design and development perspective. It's well worth the sub.",

    "This channel doesn't appear to have a named owner, but if you're too tired to dive down a rabbit hole of learning a new concept, and are interested in learning advanced CSS, this is a good channel to follow. Videos on this channel are only a few minutes long each, and will open your eyes to what's possible in CSS. It will display exactly how every element is made and styled, and what the end result will look like. Whoever hired this guy made a good move."

    "Run by a guy named Daniel out of Denmark, mmtuts, or MultiMedia Tutorials, will teach you plenty about JavaScript, as well as PHP and many other web technologies, and he will do so in an easy to understand format. His videos can be lengthy, but then again, many JavaScript videos are. He is very in-depth and will not leave you hanging with concepts."

    "Kyle bills this website as 'No Stack to Full Stack', and he's stuck to the premise of having a very simplified web development channel. He will teach you plenty of topics easily, without background noise, and minimal editing. This guy knows his stuff, and you can learn lots from him.",
