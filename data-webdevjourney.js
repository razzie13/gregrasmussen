    ["In April of 2019, after much thoughtful deliberation, I made the decision to take the leap from the grocery industry to the tech industry by means of becoming a frontend website developer. ",
    "It was not a concept that was foreign to me - I built my first website in the year 2000 using available means such as Microsoft FrontPage Express and Netscape Composer. It was fun to try new styles of webpages and see what worked and looked good and then disheartening when I would browse the sites I had built at home while at school, only to learn that not every monitor had the same level of screen resolution, and that not every computer had the same fonts installed. Those early lessons stuck with me as my amateur developer experience grew. ",
    "Before long, with the help of a wonderful friend of mine who knew - and still knows - plenty about technology, I was building full personal table-based websites which also made use of iframes, basic Javascript interactions such as jump menus, Flash animations for headers and banners, PHP scripts to gather information such as statistics on website usage and user opinions as well as to add full-featured photo galleries, using scripts to allow integration with Google Adsense, and using basic CSS to alter the look and feel of the pages. ",
    "By the late 2000s, I had run out of ideas on how to improve my website building, and rather than take on new learning, I focused on other priorities. Website building essentially stopped, although the technical know-how remained. ",
    "Fast-forward to 2019. After deciding to pick it up again and discovering that my name was available as a top-level .com domain, I bought the domain and reinstalled many of my old software programs only to discover that virtually everything had changed! Literally, it felt like the only thing that was the same was the basic HTML tags, and hex values used for colours, and even then, you could also now use RBG to define these colours. No longer did you only design for the desktop or laptop monitor - you have to also design for tablets and smartphones and make those designs responsive to the screen they were displayed on. No longer did you need to make images to create gradient backgrounds - the browser did that for you. No longer was Flash needed to make animations (although I had already known it had fallen out of favour) - CSS did that for you. It was all a huge surprise - and I knew at once that this was going to take a lot of work, but since time passes anyway, I figured that I may as well learn. ",
    "I began by slowly learning JavaScript - a process that is still ongoing as of writing this piece in November 2019 and am aiming to have completed more of by the beginning of 2020. While spending in-depth time learning JavaScript when I had large blocks of time to do so, I would learn what CSS was capable of during smaller chunks of time. I would also take the time to learn what other self-taught developers had achieved and how they achieved it, what mistakes they made that they warned not to repeat, and what tools they used to do their projects. ",
    "Over time, I became quite familiar with Visual Studio Code and its extensions, the capabilities of NPM, the usefulness of Chrome Developer Tools, and with the plethora of web-based services offering web-based fonts and icons, colour selection, and assistance with website accessibility, as well as the best places to search for help when you need it. ",
    "In addition to using various websites and YouTube channels, I chose a couple of other learning methods as well. I took a course offered through Conestoga College entitled Designing Effective Websites, a course that taught me about the steps of developing a website, data organization, and designing with the end-user in mind. I created a Udemy account as well, and have been taking courses in JavaScript, UX Design, Accessibility, and WordPress theme building. ",
    "Now, at the end of 2019, I have a personal website that has utilized everything I have learned online in the past several months and is powered by JavaScript and CSS rather than just HTML. JavaScript dynamically builds out parts of the website - including the sentence you are reading right now - based on the text I have written and stored in a data array in a separate file that I have told the JavaScript to construct. CSS then takes over, styling the page as I have told it to look. ",
    "The site itself was not conceived on a computer - it was wireframed on paper - a first for me - and once I picked the parts I liked the most and that others offered suggestions on, blended it all together. The site was then mocked up in Adobe XD to make sure it looked good and worked on screen before going to production. ",
    "Once that was achieved, accessibility standards were taken into consideration, and what has been described to me as impediments for those using a website were tested for especially, resulting in the WCAG 2.0 AA standards being met throughout the site, and a desire to find a way to get to AAA standards in the future. Another goal starting in the year 2020 is to learn React. I have already purchased the full course and have the environment installed on my machine. ",
    "Once again, welcome to my personal site. Please visit the Web Dev Projects section, where I have listed the projects I have been busy creating, as well as a section where I have toyed with new ideas using CSS and JavaScript to create various single-page projects to learn new concepts. The Development Resources page contains links to many of the pages I have used in both learnings to build the site, and in building the site itself. You can learn more about the courses I have taken in the 'About Me' section of the site, and you can contact me through my email address, as well as through Twitter, LinkedIn, or Instagram. ",
