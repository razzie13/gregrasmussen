    ["","As of December 2019, it will be my 20th Anniversary in the food industry. I have learned a ton in that timeframe - everything from deli to fresh meats to dairy to produce to running a checkout. However, in the end, nothing lasts forever, but some lessons, skills, and accomplishments remain, which I would like to highlight here. "],
    ["Lesson 1: Give your customer what they wanted to have, and maybe even a nice bonus surprise here and there.","With website development, there is plenty of opportunity to over-deliver. Be timely with projects, make the code readable and easy to understand should someone else take over the site, and help them leverage the site to draw more business. "],
    ["Lesson 2: Be Efficient.","Write JavaScript code that can be used over and over again. Back it up. Isolate the good parts in their own file. Use frameworks that make your life easier and are tried and tested. "],
    ["Lesson 3: Relationships Matter.","If you take good care of your customer, they will most likely take care of you, whether it be in the form of return business, or by word of mouth. It is very much a two-way street, and a strong relationship will only help yield maximum benefits for both parties."],
    ["Skill 1: Emergency Management.","When an event such as a power failure takes place, I am the one trusted to direct the staff to do such tasks as protect refrigerated and frozen merchandise, check customers through the tills before backup power fails on checkout, and complete any other necessary tasks that can be taken advantage of through an abundance of extra labour since nobody is able to work on checkout of with temperature-sensitive items."],
    ["Skill 2: Inventory Management.","To help ensure the right amount of product is available, stores use a Computer Assisted Ordering system to analyze sales data and automatically place orders. I have used this system and its features to ensure accurate cycle counts, accurate shelf space allocations, enough product is secured for displays, and to track and get credits for waste. In addition, I maintained the system as a whole, adding and removing employees and assigning them access to various departments."],  
    ["Skill 3: Adaptability","For a significant portion of my career, I have worked in multiple departments in the same store during the same week, or multiple stores during the same week. Each department has its own quirks and ways of doing things and performing various duties that change depending on where you happen to be became second nature to me."],  
    ["Accomplishment 1: Helping achieve an over 50% increase in sales during my main day to be the duty manager of the store over the course of several years.","By highlighting and focusing on the things that could help achieve this target the easiest, and steadily building on successes, the store eventually performed near the top of the district in sales on my days in charge."],
    ["Accomplishment 2: Over seven years without a customer slip-and-fall while being the on-duty manager","Diligent observation, employee training, and a strong desire to avoid any unpleasant customer experiences have led to this achievement."]
